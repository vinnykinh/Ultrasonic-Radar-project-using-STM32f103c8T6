# Ultrasonic-Radar-project-using-STM32f103c8T6
All you need for this Project is an Ultrasonic Sensor for detecting the objects, a small hobbyist Servo Motor for rotating the sensor and an Eris Board for controlling them. You can  read the written tutorial below.
Serial_data.pde file is just code  that goes into the processing ide. This helps process the incoming serial data from the stm32 into the radar generated.
I prefer uploading arduino version of the code as it is way simpler to grasp
